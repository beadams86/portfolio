description: <p>SPARGO needed a way to showcase their large library of products and features to clients and potential clients in a way that would engage the user. After meeting with the stakeholders, I decided the best way to engage the user would be with a filtering system that would allow the customer to only view products relevant to their needs. This would not only allow the user to narrow down their products by what's relevant to them, but added interactivity, hopefully attracting the user to stay and browse.</p><p><strong>Previously,</strong> the website was using an icon library, as good as it was for most tasks, it didn't come close to depicting the very specific products and features though, so I created an icon set that could be used for this project, as well as for other corporate needs down the road.</p><p>It took some time to nail down an effective filtering system for such a unique item, but what I decided upon was a two-step filtering process, one being more precise than the other and targeting different attributed. Additionally, I implemented a color-coded system that matched each category with a unique vibrant color.</p>This project was a blast because not only was I able to use my creativity, but I also had the ability to pick up some experience in a new front-end framework.
