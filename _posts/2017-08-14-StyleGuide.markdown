category: UI/UX Design
description: <p>SPARGO relies on many different developers to stand up registration websites based on style and branding requirements relative to many different clients. In addition, there's a separate hotel reservation CFW that uses a completely different methodology and set of developers.</p><p>In order to help standardize the process and promote consistency, I created an interactive style guide for everything from colors to forms. One of the major concerns is that every client has their own branding and color schemes, so I needed to come up with a way to standardize this to some extent, while still allowing flexibility. The solution was to limit each theme to a primary, secondary, and a complimentary color, which were mostly derived from the client's existing branding.</p><p>The stylesheet driving the base theme relies on Bootstrap 3 as a base because of the development team's familiarity with it, and with the not-so-specific guidelines I've set out there's still plenty of room to customize so it can be used across many different brand guidelines.</p>
