description: <p>My wife's grandfather had passed away the year prior and her mother was left with the burden of having to not only mourn the loss of her father, but also get all of his affairs in order. All of the paperwork, documents, passwords, accounts, had to be gathered and filed appropriately.</p><p>So my wife and I have made it our mission to design and develop a mobile application that would make this process easier and more automated.</p><p>The premise is to have a user be able to upload and store all the necessary documents for end-of-life, such as wills, bank account information, and passwords, and then send a push notification or email to a person that the user selects as their trusted next of kin.</p><p>Of course security would be a major concern with information like this, so we need to figure out how to best go about selecting a next-of-kin, how to best encrypt sensitive data, and exactly what is the minimum information someone would need to be prepared for the inevitable.</p>
