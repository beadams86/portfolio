description: <p>Originally titled J. Spargo & Associates, Inc. , my most memorable and rewarding work involved me rebranding the company to what it's known as today; SPARGO. The company had been around for over 40 years, so I wanted to pay homage to the existing legacy and brand recognition, but also wanted to give the company a modern edge.</p><p>What I decided on, after meeting with management and executives, was a logo that integrated what the company is all about, the people. The colors were partially derived from the existing logo, with a small modern twist of light blue and green.</p><p>In addition to logo, I also re-designed the company's website and branding guidelines. The website uses a fresh blue, and photographs that portray it as a corporate entity, promoting a confidence in the organization. The style guide promotes consistency and a standard to be used throughout the company's presentations to promote it's fresh look.</p>
